# Standard suppressions for test code:
# - C0114/C0115/C0116: test names are self-documenting
# - W0212: tests need to access private members
# - W0613: mock decorators inject arguments
# - R0904: test classes naturally have many test methods
# - R0913/R0914/R0917: test setup often needs many variables/arguments
# - R0801: test setup code is often similar across files
# - C0302: large test modules are normal
